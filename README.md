# Abstract

A mechanism for hierarchically encrypting triple stores, securing data temporally, and random access to data by relation.

# 1 Introduction

WNFS

- Scope: read control only; writes are out of scope of THIS spec

## 1.1 Motivation

Facts in a tuplestore are consistently 

While possible to design a system that can query by any field, all available top-down solutions trade off trust (hexastore, layered range trees) or performance (FHE, SNARK indices).

Cryptable assumes that data will most frequently be granted heirarchically. This is notably often not how data is _accessed_, but does make for a simple mental of what is being shared. It is assumed that in granting access to "everything" about an entity, that this implies all of its fields. For example, granting access to all records with a `name` attribute, or where the value field is set to `Nara` without access to the rest of the entity are less common. As such, favouring the common case for granting read access is reasonable.

TODO Time: snapshot, ranges

The design outlined in this specification MAY be extended by futher splitting data manually across multiple stores.

Once data is retrieved and decrypted, it MAY be indexed locally (e.g. hexastore). 

## 1.2 Goals


- Manage as few keys as possible
- Flexible enough to store in multiple ways (i.e. the data layer below this)

- Sensible defaults: Simple rules _inside_ a store (though stores can be broken up arbitrarily to more custom control)

TODO bring the data/object table from WNFS here

  * [x] 
- Raw decryption speed
- Seek on large stores
- Small network footprint whenever possible

# 2 Terminology

| Term             | Description                                                 |
|------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| Encrypted Region | Nestable encrypted collecions: stores, entities, attributes |
| Accessible Scope | All of the facts that the viewer is capable of decrypting   |

# 3 Query Dimensions

One of largest challenges with encypting datalog facts is that the access patterns are not known in advance. While it's possible to structure EAV(C) fields as an orthogonal $n$-dimensional tensor, and query in any order, this has major drawbacks in both the cleartext and ciphertext cases. Representing data in this way tends to rely on duplication, indexing, and/or cyclical cross linking. This is not feasible in a Byzantine threat model.

To make the problem tractable, access patterns are broken into two very broad categories which often interact: tabular heirarchy

- Nested, but you can always contruct the pointer to any position in the EAV cube deterministically without doing all of teh intermediate lookups

### 1.2.1 Tabular Heirarchy

For the pruposes of this design, we treat the quad store as a triple store $\langle e, a, \langle v, c \rangle \rangle$.

In reality, each of these relationships is completely orthogonal, but for the pruposes of access control, we simplify the base case to a linear relationship:

``` mermaid
erDiagram
    Root ||--|{ Store: owns
    Store ||--|{ Entity: contains
    Entity ||--|{ Attribute: contains
    Attribute ||--|{ Value: contains
```

This grants the ability to discover and access new enrties in the heirarchy without having to perform a linear table scan.

### 1.2.2 Stream Access

On tables

Needs work:

    subgraph S1
        s1

        subgraph E1
            s1 --> e1

            subgraph A1-1
                e1 --> a1-1
                a1-1 --> a1-1s[...]
            end

            subgraph A1-2
                direction LR

                a1-1 -.-> a1-2
                a1-2
                a1-2 --> v1-2-1

                subgraph vals
                    %% direction LR
                    

                    v1-2-1
                    v1-2-2
                    v1-2-3

                    v1-2-1 -.-> v1-2-2 -.-> v1-2-3
                end
            end
        end

        v1-2-1 -->|u * s1 * e1 * a1-2 * v1-2-1| factA
        v1-2-2 -->|u * s1 * e1 * a1-2 * v1-2-2| factB
        v1-2-3 -->|u * s1 * e1 * a1-2 * v1-2-3| factC

        subgraph facts
            factA
            factC
            factB
        end

        subgraph E2
            e2 --> e2s[...]
        end
    end

    subgraph S2
    s1 -.-> s2 --> s2s[...] 
    end
```

### 1.2.3 DAG History

History in systems like PomoDB are represented as an acyclic hash graph. 

The most general solution requires local secondary indices (or FHE). Given that these do not match our performance or 

While there are several techniques (k-anonymity, OT) that make it possible to search directly on history,


Reading a CID in the `causedBy` field of a quad MUST NOT immedietly grant access to the entire transative history. Doing so would be potentially dangerous, especially if it crossed between stores. The semantics of the `causedBy` relation do not match that of access control.

While this is an important access pattern in many graph queries, it is not desired for tabular queries. Typically the shape of graph data is more important in queries with a small number of common entities and attributes. Granting access to the entire history of those paths is thus viable.

Instead, the CrypTable ony provides searchable encyprtion via an authentication tag. This is not an HMAC, since the goal is to avoid calculating the unique key for every fact. A cryptographically secure hash function MUST be used, and a nonce based on the combination of the [scoped attribute's hash ID] MUST be concatenated to the cleartext CID before hahsing. This tag MAY be places anywhere on the fact's envelope. When stored in an associative map using this tag as the entry label is RECOMMENDED.
     
If space overhead is a concern, this tag MAY be further anonymized via truncation or XOR folding. Note that this does not increase the k-anonymity as the tag is already indistinguishable from any other tag.

This does leak a small amount of data: if a user does not have the decryption key for some fact, but has a reference to the CID in a fact that they do have access to a successor of (and thus they have the attrbte hash ID), they can discover that the fact's entity and attribute, but not it's value or causal values.

Coupled with the with the attribite tag derivation (e.g. the RSA accumluator in WNFS), scans across the store MAY be performed either strictly linearly with minimal jumps between encrypted regions.

# 2 Heirarchical Encryption

The tabular heirarchy is as follows:

1. Root
2. Stores 
3. Entities
4. Attributes
5. Values

Note that `causedBy` does not occur in this heirarchy. To have access to a point in history, the usre MUST have access to the relevant fact in the tabular heirarchy.

# 3 Key Derivation

Skip ratchet, but different use from WNFS

A store MUST be seeded with a random nonce of at least 128 bits.

A cryptstore MAY have an unlimited number of levels, but at minimum it MUST contain the following levels:

- StoreRoot
- Entity
- Attribute
- Value

Being granted access to a 

MUST be equipped with a one-way merge function that takes two or more keys and deterministically derives a new value. Concatenating and hashing with SHA2-256 or BLAKE3 is RECOMMENDED.

# 4 Semantic Collison

A field of a particular value MAY be assigned multiple times.
